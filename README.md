## NACE Competencies

Our team used several NACE career readiness competencies to complete this project

* Critical Thinking: The goal of this assignment was to translate abstract business needs into functional solutions. Each of us analyzed the WideWorldImporters database schema to formulate ten unique propositions and then made the SQL queries required to solve them, this demanded analytical skills to identify relevant data relationships and solve problems logically.

* Technology: We utilized different methods of creating the notebooks (some used azure data studio and others used juypeter notebook JSON markdown format)

* Teamwork & Communication: Although the query writing was individual, the projects success depended on our collective effort including the creation of the github repo and the discussion of the NACE competencies and project plan.

## Project Plan

Our process involved:
1.  Defining Phases: We broke the project into distinct phases: individual query development + video production, putting all our work together, then discussing the NACE competencies
2.  Setting Deadlines: We informally made deadlines for handing off individual notebooks and YouTube links to avoid procrastinating
